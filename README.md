# python-based-Sequential-Monte-Carlo-method-with-likelihood-tempering
This is code for performing sequential Monte Carlo sampling using python, incorporating likelihood tempering.

The code we provide supports parallelization, but depending on the problem and environment in which you apply it, you may need to modify the parallelization method yourself.
